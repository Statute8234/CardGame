# CardGame
The code initializes Pygame, sets display dimensions, defines functions for color blending and randomization, initializes food and bot groups, handles events, updates, draws sprites, and handles bot reproduction.

# About

The script provides a basic card game using Pygame, including definitions for cards, attributes, and buttons. It introduces random color generation and uses the Cards class to impact attributes. However, it could be more object-oriented, move game loop code into a dedicated class, and encapsulate global state for amount and max_amount. Additionally, there are no comments or error handling.

# Features

The script you describe has several features and potential areas for improvement. These include card definitions, attribute management, button interactivity, random color generation, and cards class usage. The script could benefit from a more object-oriented design to organize the code and make it more modular. Moving the game loop into a dedicated class could make the game logic clearer and more manageable. Encapsulating global state variables like `amount` and `max_amount` within classes could prevent potential issues with scope and state management. Adding comments would make the code more readable and maintainable, especially for future contributors. Implementing error handling would make the script more robust and user-friendly by gracefully handling unexpected situations. These improvements could increase the maintainability and scalability of the code. If you're looking to enhance the script further, consider these improvements to increase the code's maintainability and scalability.

# Installation

1) HTTPS - https://github.com/Statute8234/Bot-Swarm-Simulation.git
2) CLONE - Statute8234/CardGame

# Usage

1) Initialization:
   - Import the required modules (pygame, random, sys, time, numpy).
   - Initialize Pygame with pygame.init().
   - Set up the display window with the desired width and height using pygame.display.set_mode().
   - Initialize the clock for controlling the frame rate with pygame.time.Clock().
2) Define Colors:
   - Define functions for generating random colors (RANDOM_COLOR).
   - Define color constants (RED, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, BLACK) for convenience.
3) Circle Class:
   - Define a class Cards to represent the CardDeck class.

# Rating

The text evaluates the color and graphics of a card game, stating that it uses a simple but effective method for color variety and has a functional UI. The design of buttons and cards is basic but not innovative. The code structure is straightforward but could benefit from better encapsulation and reduced global state usage. The game mechanics include hover effects and card selection, but interaction is limited to basic clicking. The color-to-attributes mechanic is creative but basic.
